Alchemy Toys has a special built-in ability for up to **63 Special Toys**. These NFTs do not have a function in Alchemy Toys, but **they will play an important role in the upcoming game [Alchemy Arena](https://gat.network/alchemy-arena/)**– and they are **highly collectible because most of them are limited**. You can see the maximum supply in each Card. If there is no limit given, they are not limited. At the moment this only counts for the Dragonslayer. All other Special Toys are limited.

Over time more Special Toys will appear (63 different types in total). **One way to get them is winning a [Challenge or get an Airdrop](https://gat.network/challenges-nft-airdrops/)… Sometimes they are also available at the [Marketplace](https://minted.vodka/) by people who have won them. Sometimes you can find Special TOYs in [Treasury Deals](https://gat.network/watch-out-collectors-special-toys-available-at-minted-vodka-very-soon/) or [Liquidity Deals](https://gat.network/win-win-buy-special-toys-with-a-discount-secure-liquidity-for-gat/).**
