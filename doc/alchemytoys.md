### Have you ever played alchemy?

The game is very similar to the classic alchemy game – you collect token “cards” and “melt” them into new ones. A collection of all token types gives you a key to the treasury. When a single game (=epoch) is won by a player, the next one starts. For the new epoch you keep the cards that you have not used in the last one.

## TOYS token cards

#### The Non-Fungible BEP-721 Token

The non-fungible TOYS tokens are of 127 different types, divided into 7 different levels. A token of a type has a unique, incremental Serial Number (ID). Older tokens with lower Serial Number (ID) are more valuable.

The main aim of the game is to collect unique token cards. There are** 127 different token cards** (or token types), grouped in 7  levels. A level only shows how difficult the particular toy is to get. There are:

*   1\. Level: 64 different toy types
*   2\. Level: 32 different toy types
*   3\. Level: 16 different toy types
*   4\. Level: 8 different toy types
*   5\. Level: 4 different toy types
*   6\. Level: 2 different toy types
*   7\. Level: 1 single toy type

When the player has collected at least one card of each type, he can sacrifice them in order to win (=“**attain enlightenment**”).

**Every time a token of a Toy type is created, it receives an incremental unique Serial Number for this toy type – making this token a unique NFT**. When a token is used (in “sacrifice” or “melting”, see actions below), this NFT is burned forever.

Generally the value of a token is determined by its level (the higher the better) and its serial number (the lower the better).

## Cycles and Epochs

#### Game Timing

The game is turn based. A player can make a limited amount of turns per cycle. A cycle usually goes for 8 hours. When any player wins the game (“attains enlightenment”), a new epoch is started for all players.

What happens when new epochs starts?

**The alchemy recipes are reset.** The players need to find out again what token type is generated by combining two others. This makes every new epoch unpredictable and incentivizes strategic hoarding of TOYS tokens by traders.

**Most of the treasury is paid out** to the winners and the stakers.

**How long does an epoch last ?** As long as it takes for any player to win the current epoch’s game. It could be days or weeks.

### Invent your unique winning strategy

A player is allowed to take only 5 turns (=actions) every cycle. There are four different actions to choose from at our temple. Sometimes, not taking an action can also be a wise move. Every action costs a temple fee that is deposited into the temple’s treasury.

## Get 3 random cards

#### Action #1: Worship

An ancient ritual allows the player to summon the Alchemic Deity and receive 3 random cards of the lowest level. However, there is a fair chance of getting a higher-level card.

There is a 1 in 8 chance of getting a higher level card type. So, each card has 1/8 chance of being of level 2, 1/64 of level 3, 1/512 of level 4, etc. In most cases you will receive a token of level 1, though.

Each newly created token has an incremental numeric ID, which is unique for each token type. Older tokens, that were created earlier, have a lower ID. This might play a role in the sacrifice action below.

At this point, the NFT tokens (BEP-721 compliant) are free to be used, sold, exchanged, etc.

## Burn 2 tokens – get a better one

#### Action #2: Melt

Two tokens are placed into the circle of fire to be burned (these tokens are lost forever), resulting in a new token of a higher level. The level of the new token is +1 higher than the average of the tokens being fused.

If these two tokens have not yet been melted together in the current epoch, a new alchemy recipe is generated. This recipe dictates what is the most likely outcome for these two token types.

**This combination stays the same just for the rest of the epoch**. In the next epoch the same two cards may lead to a completely different outcome.

The player who tries a new combination for the first time receives an** additional, random card of a lower level**, incentivizing alchemic experimentation. This player receives 2 cards instead of 1.

## Burn tokens on the way to enlightenment

#### Action #3: Sacrifice

A player can sacrifice tokens at any point. Once he has sacrificed at least one token of each type, he automatically receives the ‘enlightenment’ token.

Every toy must be sacrificed one by one and costs one turn. Be aware, that **your sacrifice is not lost across epochs** ! If you fail to win in an epoch, all the attained sacrifice will be transferred to the new epoch.

Sacrificing a token destroys it forever. **Be aware, that older tokens are more valuable** ! When several players reach a full sacrifice in an epoch, the one who burnt older toys gets a bigger cut of the temple’s treasury.

As a result of a full sacrifice the player receives an **enlightenment token**. This token is later exchanged for the “Godhood” token in the proclamation ritual (read below).

Please be aware that there is a **maximum of 7 enlightened players in a game epoch **! This means that if you are the 8th, you will not be able to sacrifice the last card and will have to wait for the next epoch.

## The coming of a new God

#### Action #4: Proclamation

Any player can assume the role of a prophet and proclaim the start of an ascension ritual when at least one ‘enlightenment’ token exists.

The proclamation burns the enlightenment tokens and gives the winners a new ‘Godhood’ token. It does not have any function yet, but will get one in the follow-up games.

At least one cycle has to pass since the creation of the last ‘enlightenment token’. Then any quick player can start the proclamation ritual, thus becoming the prophet of the current epoch. The prophet gets paid for this service, of course.

Be aware that **there may exist more than one winner of an epoch** . In that case the place of the winner is determined by the value of the sacrificed toys (the older, the better).

## A New Beginning

#### Payday

The Calendar is reset and a new epoch is initiated, with new recipes and new possibilities.

All the unused tokens remain in the wallets. Also, if a player has already sacrificed some toys, this sacrifice is transferred to the new epoch.

Also, the temple treasury is paid out to the entitled parties. Namely:

*   **64% of the treasury.** The enlightened winners.
*   **20% of the treasury.** The shamans are paid, they are the stakers of the mystic GAT token.
*   **1% of the treasury.** The prophet gets paid for his service of running the proclamation ritual.
*   **15% remain in the treasury for the next epoch.**

## Sacrifice Index

#### More than one winner in an epoch?

The winnings are split proportionally to the Sacrifice Index, which is the sum of the serial numbers of sacrificed cards.

If there are several winners, their winnings (64%) are split by their attained Sacrifice Index. Each winner can see his Sacrifice Index  on the received Enlightenment Token. It is calculated as a **sum of all the Serial Numbers (#) **of all the cards that the corresponding player has sacrificed.  **Lower index means that the player has sacrificed an older collection** and is thus eligible for a bigger cut of the winnings.

Example: Two enlightened players (A and B). A  = 1000, B  = 500. Sum = 1500. Player A gets (1500-1000)/1500=33.33% . Player B gets (1500-500)/1500=66.66% .

If player B had  = 250, his reward would change dramatically to (1250-250)/1250=80%. Therefore, **old cards gain value fast as they give you a bigger chunk of the treasure!**

### Game Economics: Financial Stability & Growth

The underlying core of the game is financial stability and perpetual growth through a delicate system of automatic incentives and adjustments. **All fees flow 100% into the game treasury** . Whereas all fees and payouts are settled in the network’s (“BNB Chain”) base currency (BNB), the game itself has two different token types: Toy NFTs and GATs (Game Ace Tokens).

![](https://gat.network/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/toys-and-gat.png)

## Toy NFTs

#### Backed by the growing Game Treasury

Toy NFTs value is upheld by the game treasury (in underlying networks base currency BNB) Furthermore, they become more valuable with time.

Every token symbolizes a piece of the treasury reward. Once you collect and sacrifice all 127 tokens, a big chunk of the treasury is paid out to you in base currency (BNB). **Every token has thus an intrinsic guarantee of a future payout**.

The payouts are directly in BNB, therefore **there is no pressure to sell the NFTs **for economic rewards.

When a player fails to win in an epoch, he still maintains his collection and has a better position to win in the next epoch. **Sooner or later: every token minted will be used for winning an epoch** .

New unique Toy NFTs are minted during two game actions (“worship” and “melt”). The corresponding fees (minus network fees) flow 100% to the temple’s treasury, thus **new minting does not dilute the token’s value**.

Tokens are also irreversibly destroyed when used (during “melt” and “sacrifice” actions), **increasing the intrinsic value of remaining tokens**.

Older tokens give a player a competitive advantage when winner’s share of the treasury is determined. **This incentivizes Toy collection and trade**. A corresponding market is provided, but other markets can be used, too (Toys are BEP721-compliant ).

**Collected toys bring intrinsic values into future games** :

*   Upcoming games are planned that use these tokens, too.
*   Some special tokens (like the Godhood token of the winner) will give further privileges in future games.

## Game Ace Tokens (GAT)

#### A multi-purpose BEP-20 token for staking & more!

GATs are pre-mined and limited to a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens. They are used by investors to participate in the yield farming of Alchemy Toys and all related DApps

GATs give you a way to earn rewards from the financial dynamics of Alchemy Toys, NFT Marketplace and further games. As a **highly versatile DeFi-vehicle**, they are a way to support the projects in an early stage and automatically secure financial payouts ad-infinitum. Furthermore, you are able to use them as a privileged payment method at the marketplace – trades with GAT are free of marketplace fees.

GATs are pre-mined. Limited to 1,000,000 tokens they have a rather **deflationary effect on the eco-system** .

The payouts are direct, in the network’s (BNB Chain) underlying currency token (BNB). As with Toy NFTs, there is **no pressure to sell the GATs to be able to profit economically** , making the system’s financial dynamics more stable.

A staker can choose to lock his GATs in one of the projects to be able to participate in the yield farming. Future games are already in the planning phase, where the same tokens will be used in a similar manner.

The deflationary characteristic of GAT + growth potential of Alchemy Toys and the NFT Marketplace (Minted Vodka) + future projects; all these factors lead to **possibly perpetually growing returns and an increasing value of GAT** .

In Alchemy Toys you are required to stak your GAT for at least one full game epoch before you become eligible for rewards. The game rewards the staked GAT-owners proportionally to the stak’s size. 20% of the epoch’s treasury goes to GAT-stakers (we call them “shamans” in the game). **This approach hinders pump&dump dynamics and gives the system more stability** .

## The Game Treasury’s Balance

#### Keeping the economic cycles intact

Alchemy Toys ensures financial stability and growth, especially in the most critical time: between the game epochs.

Between the epochs the game treasury drops because of the payouts. Even then – the system is designed to ensure economic stability and create the necessary conditions for a continuos growth.

The treasury will continue to grow:

*   **15% remain as an incentive for the next game epoch**
*   Players who have not won, but hold Toys, have **an interest to continue playing** to win in the current epoch. All turn fees go into the treasury.
*   The shamans, who stake GATs, are required to lock their tokens for at least one full epoch. This **prevents pump&dump**.
*   All fees gathered on our NFT Marketplace flow into the treasury.

**Bearish pressure creates a strong bullish response**. For example, some possible scenarios:

*   Many shamans unlock their GATs (in order to sell them) → the ROI is increased for the remaining stakers → GAT’s value increased!
*   Traders dump many TOYs on the market → winning an epoch becomes more probable → demand for TOYs increased.

| Comparison | Usual AltCoin / DeFi / NFT | Alchemy Toys Ecosystem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **NFT’s Value** |  No underlying value (= fiat) |   Backed by the growing game treasury (= gold standard) |
| **Currency for payouts** |   AltCoin |   Network’s base currency ( BNB ) |
| **Objectives & Cycles** |   Everyone chases the same carrot, only one economic cycle |   Many ways to play and profit |
| **Behavior during Bear Markets** |   Downward pressure, profit-taking potentiates bearish trends |  No downward pressure, bearish actions trigger bullish responses |
| **Financial Stability** |  High volatility, bank-runs on lower ends of a cycle |   Noise-cancelling of price tsunamis, stability |
| **Price of NFTs** |  Fixed, astronomical if base currency grows in value |   Dynamic, adjusts itself automatically |
| **Use of Tokens** |   None, single or limited purpose |   TOYs and GATs used in many DApps → price stability |

## Minted Vodka: The NFT Exchange

#### Trade TOYs and other NFTs/coins in any combination !

A dedicated [NFT Marketplace](https://gat.network/minted-vodka/) is provided to players to facilitate trade. You can also use other platforms or trade other NFTs on Minted Vodka as well.

**[Minted Vodka](https://minted.vodka)** is created as a flexible NFT Marketplace. You can sell any BEP721-compliant NFT here. You are also able to swap NFTs. In the near future a proper minting will be provided. The trading comes with a flat trading fee.

Minted Vodka has a special relationship with Alchemy Toys. **Most fees gathered for trading flow automatically into the game’s treasury** ! A part of the collected trading fees will serve as a reward for GAT stakers.

This adds interesting dynamics to the game, if you also consider further factors like:

*   TOYs gain value with time.
*   TOYs have an intrinsic collectible value.
*   TOYs value also follow game epoch cycles.
*   TOYs are irreversibly destroyed in different game actions.
*   Turn fees can fluctuate depending on the market cycles.
*   TOYs will be used in other upcoming games.

… we get **a myriad of possibilities for speculation and unique lucrative trading strategies** !
